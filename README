mate-session
=============

mate-session contains the MATE session manager, as well as a
configuration program to choose applications starting on login.


Installation
============

In order to build this program from the source code you need git installed and
 a working MATE environment, with the development tools installed properly.

git submodule init
git submodule update --remote --recursive
./autogen.sh
make
make install


Screensaver
===========

Only xscreensaver is supported. mate-screensaver support was dropped after
copyright infringements on August 10, 2022.

On Fedora you must uninstall mate-screensaver and enable xscreensaver daemon:

sudo dnf remove mate-screensaver
sudo sed -i '/mate-screensaver/d' /usr/libexec/xscreensaver-autostart
sudo sed -i '/OnlyShowIn/d' /etc/xdg/autostart/xscreensaver-autostart.desktop
